# Protools POC - Flowable Engine ü¶ä
[Demo Link üòâ](https://protools.dev.insee.io/)

This POC was build to test Flowable BPMN Engine as part of my final year intership.

This project has two main branches: 
- protools-wip (work in progress)
- protools-demo (demo project for monthly report)

‚ùå Do not attempt to merge those branches into main. (Self reminder because I'm forgetful)
